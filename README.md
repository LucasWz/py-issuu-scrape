# Issuu Scraper (Python)

Basic Issuu scraper, and since I'm not an expert at Python, this is a simple script and nothing advanced or special. It still does the trick though. :) Enter the url, and then enter the number of pages the book has. The program will then do the rest by downloading each image, compiling into a pdf, and outputting the urls and information in separate text files.

You'll need to install urllib and BeautifulSoup via pip3 before you can use this script. This tool is not compatibile with Python 2.

This script was inspired and is based on the Ruby script from pietrop: https://github.com/pietrop/issuu.com-downloader
